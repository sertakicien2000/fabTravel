# TripShare

MERN stack application showcasing trips, travel plans, photos/videos and reviews of places visited.

Today, we have completed our fully functional app. Of course, we still had additional features we would like to add, but without further ado - TripShare!

The project uses an API from MapBox, which is similar to Google Maps but much more customizable.  We added in a login page, and we created a new location page as well as a view history page of added locations/descriptions.  We used Materialize for the design features, Mongo DB for the database, a boiler plate for the routes, React.js components, Express, CSS, NPM Turf (additional styling for Mapbox), and NPM multer (in order to upload photos into Mongo DB).

We present to you a travel blog materialized in the form of your personal online passport.  You can add photos, past trips, and details about a certain restaurant or experience during your trip, and you can share amongst family and friends.  We added a map which can show you where your friends or family have visited. Another feature would include trip planning.

In the first step, our users would sign up and move over to the create page in order to view the map to plan or to write about an experience.  Next, the user has the option to share more information or upload a photo.  Lastly, we can check out the view page in order to witness your list of places.

Below here we have a few sneak peeks:
